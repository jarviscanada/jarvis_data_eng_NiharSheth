# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: "I am a computer engineering graduate from Ryerson University. I chose to pursue this field of study early on as I always have been interested in computers and working with them. During my undergrad, I gained experience and exposure to various fields such as software design, computer networks and security and data engineering. I found that software and data engineering captured my interest, and I decided to further my career. What fascinates me about data engineering is its versatility as it applies to nearly every industry out there, and its importance is only growing with time."

    description: "Implemented a monitoring agent on CentOS 7 using Bash and SQL that gathers Linux host information from various machines within a cluster and aggregates them in a single database using PostgreSQL within a Docker container. Static hardware information is stored for each host in one table while resource usage for each host is pushed to the database every minute automatically using crontab. This project was an implementation of basic data analytic tecniques."

      - "JDBC App: Wrote a Java program that implements Java Database Connectivity to interface with a PostgreSQL database using the data access object design pattern to perform create, read, update and delete operations on an individual table in the database. The program connects to the database using a JDBC driver class."
      - "Grep App: Wrote a Java program that mimics the usage of the grep command line utility to search for text through files using regex pattern matching. Given a root directory the program gets a list of all files within it and any subdirectories recursively and searches them individually for a passed regex pattern, results are then stored in a text file. The application is deployed as a Docker image."
