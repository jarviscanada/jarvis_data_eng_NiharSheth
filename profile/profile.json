Given a root directory the program gets a list of all files within it and any subdirectories recursively and searches them individually for a passed regex pattern, results are then stored in a text file. The application is deployed as a Docker image.",

During my undergrad, I gained experience and exposure to various fields such as software design, computer networks and security and data engineering. I found that software and data engineering captured my interest, and I decided to further my career. What fascinates me about data engineering is its versatility as it applies to nearly every industry out there, and its importance is only growing with time."
